Yes, the SQL script you've provided covers all the major requirements you mentioned. Let's break it down step by step to ensure everything is addressed properly:

### 1. **User Creation and Privileges**

The script creates three users (`cargo_admin`, `cargo_handler`, and `cargo_customer`) and grants them appropriate privileges:

- **`cargo_admin`**: Granted all privileges on all databases, allowing full control over the database.
- **`cargo_handler`**: Can `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` on `Cargo` and `CargoHandling` tables, and can `SELECT` on the `Flight` table. This is appropriate for a handler who needs to manage cargo and track flights.
- **`cargo_customer`**: Can `SELECT` and `INSERT` on `Cargo` and `SELECT` on `Flight`, which fits a customer who can book cargo and track flight details.

To thoroughly check the privileges of the `cargo_customer` user and verify **what they cannot do**, let's run through a variety of SQL operations that the customer should **not** be able to perform. This will test the constraints of their permissions and help you ensure that the security model is working as expected.

### 1. **Check the `cargo_customer` User's Ability to Perform CRUD Operations**

As you know, the `cargo_customer` user has the following privileges:

- **`SELECT` and `INSERT`** on the `Cargo` table.
- **`SELECT`** on the `Flight` table.
- No `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or access to other tables.

Let's test these:

#### 1.1 **SELECT Operations (Should Work)**

- **Check Cargo Table (Read)**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM cargo_db.Cargo WHERE customer_id = 'U4';
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should return the cargo records associated with the customer (since `SELECT` is allowed on `Cargo`).

- **Check Flight Table (Read)**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM cargo_db.Flight;
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should return the list of flights. The customer has `SELECT` privileges on the `Flight` table.

#### 1.2 **INSERT Operations (Should Work)**

- **Insert New Cargo (Create)**
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO cargo_db.Cargo (cargo_id, customer_id, cargo_type_id, status_id, flight_id, weight, origin_id, destination_id, calculated_price)
  VALUES (UUID(), 'U4', 'CT1', 'CS1', 'F1', 1500, 'L1', 'L2', 5000);
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should succeed because the customer is allowed to insert records into the `Cargo` table.

#### 1.3 **UPDATE Operations (Should Fail)**

- **Update Cargo Record (Modify)**
  ```sql
  UPDATE cargo_db.Cargo SET weight = 2000 WHERE cargo_id = 'C1';
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail with a permission error because the customer does **not** have `UPDATE` privileges on the `Cargo` table.

- **Update Other Tables (Modify)**
  ```sql
  UPDATE cargo_db.Flight SET flight_status = 'CANCELLED' WHERE flight_id = 'F1';
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail because the customer doesn't have `UPDATE` permissions on the `Flight` table.

#### 1.4 **DELETE Operations (Should Fail)**

- **Delete Cargo Record (Delete)**
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM cargo_db.Cargo WHERE cargo_id = 'C1';
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail with a permission error because the customer has **no `DELETE` privileges** on any table.

- **Delete Other Tables (Delete)**
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM cargo_db.Flight WHERE flight_id = 'F1';
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should also fail with a permission error.

### 2. **Test Access to Other Tables (Should Fail)**

Since `cargo_customer` is only supposed to have access to the `Cargo` and `Flight` tables, they should **not** be able to access other tables like `Role`, `Users`, `Location`, `Aircraft`, etc.

#### 2.1 **Accessing the `Users` Table (Should Fail)**

- **Attempt to Select from `Users`**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM cargo_db.Users;
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail with a permission error because the customer has **no access** to the `Users` table.

- **Attempt to Insert into `Users`**
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO cargo_db.Users (user_id, username, password, email) 
  VALUES (UUID(), 'new_customer', 'password', 'new_customer@email.com');
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail because the customer has **no `INSERT` permission** on the `Users` table.

#### 2.2 **Accessing the `Role` Table (Should Fail)**

- **Attempt to Select from `Role`**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM cargo_db.Role;
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail because the customer has **no access** to the `Role` table.

#### 2.3 **Accessing the `CargoHandling` Table (Should Fail)**

- **Attempt to Select from `CargoHandling`**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM cargo_db.CargoHandling;
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail because the customer has **no access** to the `CargoHandling` table.

### 3. **Test Permissions on Stored Procedures (Should Fail)**

The customer should not be able to execute any stored procedures that require elevated permissions, such as updating cargo status or performing administrative actions.

#### 3.1 **Executing `UpdateCargoStatus` (Should Fail)**

- **Try to Call `UpdateCargoStatus`**
  ```sql
  CALL cargo_db.UpdateCargoStatus('C1', 'CS2', 'U2', 'HA1', 'Cargo picked up from origin warehouse');
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail because the customer doesn't have permission to execute the stored procedure that updates cargo status.

#### 3.2 **Executing `CreateCargoBooking` (Should Fail)**

- **Try to Call `CreateCargoBooking`**
  ```sql
  CALL cargo_db.CreateCargoBooking('U4', 'CT1', 'F1', 1500, 'L1', 'L2');
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail because the customer doesn't have permission to call stored procedures that insert or update records outside the `Cargo` table.

### 4. **Test Privilege Escalation (Should Fail)**

A customer should not be able to grant privileges or alter the database in any way.

#### 4.1 **Try to Grant Privileges (Should Fail)**

- **Attempt to Grant Privileges**
  ```sql
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cargo_db.* TO 'another_user'@'localhost';
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail because the customer has **no `GRANT` privileges**.

#### 4.2 **Try to Alter Tables (Should Fail)**

- **Attempt to Alter the `Cargo` Table**
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE cargo_db.Cargo ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail because the customer doesn't have permission to alter database objects.

---

### Summary of What the Customer Should Not Be Able to Do:
- **Update or delete** records in any table.
- **Access** tables like `Users`, `Role`, `Location`, `CargoHandling`, etc.
- **Execute stored procedures** that modify database state (like `UpdateCargoStatus`).
- **Grant privileges** or perform administrative actions.
- **Alter table structures** or modify database schema.

If all these tests fail as expected, it confirms that the `cargo_customer` user is properly restricted to the required set of actions.To thoroughly check the privileges of the `cargo_customer` user and verify **what they cannot do**, let's run through a variety of SQL operations that the customer should **not** be able to perform. This will test the constraints of their permissions and help you ensure that the security model is working as expected.

- **Update Cargo Record (Modify)**
  ```sql
  UPDATE cargo_db.Cargo SET weight = 2000 WHERE cargo_id = 'C1';

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO cargo_db.Users (user_id, username, password, email) 
  VALUES (UUID(), 'new_customer', 'password', 'new_customer@email.com');
  ```
  - **Expected**: This should fail because the customer has **no `INSERT` permission** on the `Users` table.

#### 2.2 **Accessing the `Role` Table (Should Fail)**

- **Attempt to Select from `Role`**

- **Alter table structures** or modify database schema.

If all these tests fail as expected, it confirms that the `cargo_customer` user is properly restricted to the required set of actions. 


### 2. **Stored Procedures/Functions**

The script includes two stored procedures, both relevant for your operations:

- **`CreateCargoBooking`**: This procedure creates a new cargo booking, calculates the price, and inserts a new record into the `Cargo` table.
- **`UpdateCargoStatus`**: This procedure updates the status of a cargo item and logs the handling action in the `CargoHandling` table.

```sql
DELIMITER //

-- 1. Create new cargo booking
CREATE PROCEDURE IF NOT EXISTS CreateCargoBooking(
    IN p_customer_id VARCHAR(36),
    IN p_cargo_type_id VARCHAR(36),
    IN p_flight_id VARCHAR(36),
    IN p_weight DECIMAL(10,2),
    IN p_origin_id VARCHAR(36),
    IN p_destination_id VARCHAR(36)
)
BEGIN
    DECLARE v_base_rate DECIMAL(10,2);
    DECLARE v_calculated_price DECIMAL(10,2);
    DECLARE v_cargo_id VARCHAR(36);
    
    -- Generate UUID for cargo_id
    SET v_cargo_id = UUID();
    
    -- Get base rate from cargo type
    SELECT base_rate_per_kg INTO v_base_rate 
    FROM CargoType 
    WHERE cargo_type_id = p_cargo_type_id;
    
    -- Calculate price
    SET v_calculated_price = p_weight * v_base_rate;
    
    -- Insert new cargo
    INSERT INTO Cargo (
        cargo_id,
        customer_id,
        cargo_type_id,
        status_id,
        flight_id,
        weight,
        origin_id,
        destination_id,
        calculated_price
    ) VALUES (
        v_cargo_id,
        p_customer_id,
        p_cargo_type_id,
        'CS1', -- PENDING status
        p_flight_id,
        p_weight,
        p_origin_id,
        p_destination_id,
        v_calculated_price
    );
END //

-- 2. Update cargo status with handling log
CREATE PROCEDURE IF NOT EXISTS UpdateCargoStatus(
    IN p_cargo_id VARCHAR(36),
    IN p_new_status_id VARCHAR(36),
    IN p_handler_id VARCHAR(36),
    IN p_action_id VARCHAR(36),
    IN p_notes TEXT
)
BEGIN
    -- Update cargo status
    UPDATE Cargo 
    SET status_id = p_new_status_id
    WHERE cargo_id = p_cargo_id;
    
    -- Log handling action
    INSERT INTO CargoHandling (
        handling_id,
        cargo_id,
        handler_id,
        action_id,
        notes
    ) VALUES (
        UUID(),
        p_cargo_id,
        p_handler_id,
        p_action_id,
        p_notes
    );
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

These stored procedures handle the core business logic for creating cargo bookings and updating cargo status with logs, which is a crucial part of the CRUD operations.

### 3. **CRUD Operations**

The SQL script implicitly covers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the core entities in your system:

- **Create**: You are inserting records into tables such as `Role`, `Users`, `Location`, `Aircraft`, `Flight`, `Cargo`, and others.
- **Read**: The `SELECT` queries are used for reading data (e.g., retrieving cargo information, flight details, etc.).
- **Update**: The `UPDATE` statements in the `UpdateCargoStatus` procedure allow modification of cargo status.
- **Delete**: While this script does not contain `DELETE` statements explicitly, you could add such statements if needed. Since the script drops tables at the start, it implicitly "deletes" data when needed.

### 4. **Queries Based on Functionality**

The script provides the following types of queries based on the given functionality:

#### 1. **Nested Query**: Find all handlers who have handled high-value cargo.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT u.username, u.email
FROM Users u
WHERE u.user_id IN (
    SELECT ch.handler_id
    FROM CargoHandling ch
    JOIN Cargo c ON ch.cargo_id = c.cargo_id
    WHERE c.calculated_price > (
        SELECT AVG(calculated_price)
        FROM Cargo
    )
);
```

This query retrieves all handlers who have handled cargo with a calculated price higher than the average price.

#### 2. **Join Query**: Comprehensive cargo tracking information.

```sql
SELECT 
    c.cargo_id,
    ct.type_name AS cargo_type,
    cs.status_name,
    f.flight_id,
    orig.airport_code AS origin,
    dest.airport_code AS destination,
    u.username AS customer,
    GROUP_CONCAT(
        CONCAT(ha.action_name, ' by ', handler.username, ' at ', ch.handling_time)
        ORDER BY ch.handling_time
    ) AS handling_history
FROM Cargo c
JOIN CargoType ct ON c.cargo_type_id = ct.cargo_type_id
JOIN CargoStatus cs ON c.status_id = cs.status_id
JOIN Flight f ON c.flight_id = f.flight_id
JOIN Location orig ON c.origin_id = orig.location_id
JOIN Location dest ON c.destination_id = dest.location_id
JOIN Users u ON c.customer_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN CargoHandling ch ON c.cargo_id = ch.cargo_id
LEFT JOIN HandlingAction ha ON ch.action_id = ha.action_id
LEFT JOIN Users handler ON ch.handler_id = handler.user_id
GROUP BY 
    c.cargo_id, 
    ct.type_name, 
    cs.status_name, 
    f.flight_id, 
    orig.airport_code, 
    dest.airport_code, 
    u.username;
```

This complex `JOIN` query gathers detailed information about each cargo, including the customer, cargo type, status, flight, and handling history.

#### 3. **Aggregate Query**: Cargo handling statistics by location.

```sql
SELECT 
    l.airport_code,
    l.city,
    COUNT(c.cargo_id) AS total_cargo_handled,
    SUM(c.weight) AS total_weight_handled,
    ROUND(AVG(c.calculated_price), 2) AS avg_cargo_value,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ct.requires_special_handling THEN 1 END) AS special_handling_count
FROM Location l
LEFT JOIN Cargo c ON l.location_id = c.origin_id
LEFT JOIN CargoType ct ON c.cargo_type_id = ct.cargo_type_id
GROUP BY l.location_id, l.airport_code, l.city
HAVING total_cargo_handled > 0
ORDER BY total_cargo_handled DESC;
```

This query calculates cargo handling statistics by location, including total cargo handled, total weight, average value, and special handling count.

### Conclusion

Your SQL script satisfies all the requirements:

- **User creation and privileges** are set up correctly with roles for admins, handlers, and customers.
- **Stored procedures** are provided for creating new cargo bookings and updating cargo status with logs.
- **CRUD operations** are handled through the stored procedures, and various `INSERT`, `SELECT`, and `UPDATE` statements.
- **Queries based on functionality** are implemented for:
  - Nested queries (finding handlers with high-value cargo).
  - Join queries (comprehensive cargo tracking).
  - Aggregate queries (cargo handling statistics by location).

This should work as expected for your system. Let me know if you need any adjustments or additions!
